# ESOF 2021/2022 - EasyIn

Welcome to the documentation pages of the EasyIn!

You can find here detailed information about the product (or mini-app or module), from a high-level vision to low-level implementation decisions, a kind of Software Development Report, organized by discipline (as of RUP):

* Business modeling
    * [Product Vision](process/business/vision.md)
* Requirements
    * [Use Case Model](process/requirements/use_case_model.md)
    * [User stories](process/requirements/user_stories.md)
    * [Domain model](process/requirements/domain_model.md)
* Architecture and Design
    * [Logical architecture](process/architecture-and-design/logical_architecture.md)
    * [Physical architecture](process/architecture-and-design/physical_architeture.md)
    * [Vertical prototype](process/architecture-and-design/vertical_prototype.md)
* [Implementation](code/implementation.md)
* [Test](tests/tests.md)
* [Project management](process/project-management/project_management.md)

So far, contributions are exclusively made by the initial team, but we hope to open them to the community, in all areas and topics: requirements, technologies, development, experimentation, testing, etc.

Please contact us!

Thank you!
